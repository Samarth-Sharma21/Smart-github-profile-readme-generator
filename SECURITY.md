The GitHub Profile README Generator implements several security measures:

1. **No Server-Side Storage**: All README generation happens client-side. We don't store your data on our servers.
2. **No Tracking**: We respect your privacy and don't track your README content.
3. **Regular Dependency Updates**: We regularly update our dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
4. **Content Security Policy**: We implement strict CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks.
